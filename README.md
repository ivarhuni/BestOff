# ReykjavÃ­k Grapevine BestOff
## Introduction

This is the repo for the Reykjavik Grapevine Best Off iOS App.
The app is under active development, scheduled to be released in April/May 2019.

So far I've been experiencing with code generation of datamodels curtesy of http://www.jsoncafe.com/
It's pretty rad, you can paste in a JSON and get generated datamodels based on your JSON in a programming language of your choice!

The app is written in MVVM and uses ReactiveKit and Bond for databindings. 
I'll make sure to list other libraries here as the project progresses.
