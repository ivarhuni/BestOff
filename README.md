# Reykjavík Grapevine BestOff
## Introduction

This is the repo for the Reykjavik Grapevine Best Off iOS App.
The app is under active development, scheduled to be released in April/May 2019.

So far I've been experiencing with code generation of datamodels curtesy of http://www.jsoncafe.com/  

coupled with Swift's new Codable protocol, you can generate your data models easily by setting the  

code generator to Swift Decodable and input a sample json 

The app is written in MVVM and uses ReactiveKit and Bond for databindings.
