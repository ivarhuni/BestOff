## Tools / Miscellaneous / Code generation  

Datamodels generated with http://www.jsoncafe.com/  

coupled with Swift's new Codable protocol, you can generate your data models easily by setting the  

code generator to Swift Decodable and input a sample json. Highly recommend it!

The app is written in MVVM and uses ReactiveKit and Bond for UI databinding:
